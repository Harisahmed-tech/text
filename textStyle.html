    <h1>Photography - My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    
    <p class="main-para">
        Photography has been my passion for the past three years. I love capturing 
        moments that tell a story, whether it's a sunset over the city or candid 
        shots of friends laughing together. There's something magical about freezing 
        time in a single frame. I usually go out early in the morning to catch the 
        golden hour light, which makes everything look amazing. My favorite subjects 
        are landscapes and street photography because they're always unpredictable.There's something magical about freezing

        What I enjoy most is experimenting with different angles and perspectives. 
        Sometimes the best shots come from lying on the ground or climbing up high 
        to get a unique view. I've learned that patience is key in photography - 
        waiting for the right moment can make all the difference. My camera has 
        become my constant companion on adventures and everyday walks alike.I've learned that patience is key in photography -
